## General Presentation

This year again, heat waves have hit the university campus hard. Fortunately, the trees and green spaces helped users withstand the temperature. To further improve the situation, the university would like to plant trees so that all the areas used are covered by their cooling effect. However, trees cannot be planted in paved/concrete areas, where they must be replaced with parasols, which are less effective. Paved areas also reflect heat, which further limits the spread of coolness.

The project will take place in several steps:

 1. modeling of the problem;  
 2. implementation of algorithms (brute force, etc.);  
 3. adding extensions.  

 Regarding organization:
 
 * groups of 3 or 4 students;  
 * the final version must be submitted before the Christmas holidays, and oral defenses will take place in January;  
 * intermediate submissions will also be required.  

## Problem

We propose the following problem: How can trees be placed so that all of the campus areas in use (sidewalks, etc.) are covered by shade? What is the minimal number of trees to place in order to cover these areas?  

In a second stage, you will consider related problems with parasols and with variations in the distance covered depending on the type of terrain.  

You may also propose your own variants of the problem, provided you justify why they are relevant.  

You will present your results graphically in order to make them easier to understand.  

## Data

To carry out the project, you will need cartographic data of the campus. These can be obtained via OpenStreetMap, for example by using [overpass](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) queries. You may also use other open sources that you find. [osmnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) could also be useful if you choose to do your project in Python.  

## For October 2

Each group will prepare a short presentation of the modeling. The tools chosen for the implementation will also be presented.
